# **Hyperparameter Sweep Evaluation and Redesign Report**

## **Overview**

This report presents the analysis of a Bayesian hyperparameter sweep for a classic U-Net segmentation model and recommends a new sweep configuration optimized for use with a high-memory NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPU (48GB VRAM). The sweep objective is to maximize the validation Dice coefficient on 256×256 images.

## **Previous Sweep Findings**

* **Best validation Dice coefficient**: ≈0.569
* **Optimal configuration**:

  * **batch\_size**: 16
  * **learning\_rate**: \~0.000159
  * **dropout**: \~0.20
  * **l2\_reg**: \~0.00006
* **Batch size trend**: Larger batch sizes (16) outperformed smaller ones, and the model did not show signs of overfitting with moderate dropout and low L2 regularization.
* **Parameter impact**:

  * Lower learning rates and moderate dropout improved performance.
  * Small but nonzero L2 regularization was beneficial.

## **Hardware Considerations: RTX 6000 Ada**

* The NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPU provides **48GB VRAM**—sufficient to support very large batch sizes, even for complex models or larger input images.
* For 256×256 images and classic U-Net, you can confidently test batch sizes **32, 64, and even 128** without out-of-memory risk.
* Training speed will improve, and larger batch sizes may allow for higher learning rates or benefit from additional regularization.

## **New Sweep Design**

Based on the above findings and hardware resources, the following sweep configuration is recommended:

```yaml
program: train.py
method: bayes
metric:
  name: val_dice_coefficient
  goal: maximize
parameters:
  batch_size:
    values: [16, 32, 64, 128]
  learning_rate:
    distribution: uniform
    min: 0.00008
    max: 0.0015         # Slightly expanded upper bound for possible LR scaling
  dropout:
    distribution: uniform
    min: 0.15
    max: 0.25
  l2_reg:
    distribution: uniform
    min: 0.00001
    max: 0.00015
  epochs:
    value: 40
  input_shape:
    value: [256, 256, 1]
  task:
    value: segmentation
```

**Notes:**

* **Batch sizes**: 16–128, leveraging the RTX 6000 Ada’s ample memory.
* **Learning rate**: Narrowed to best-performing region, but slightly expanded at the top for possible large-batch scaling.
* **Dropout and L2 regularization**: Kept within empirically successful ranges.
* **Epochs, input shape, and task**: Unchanged for comparability.

## **Recommendations**

* **Monitor training for diminishing returns** at batch sizes >64 (very large batches can sometimes harm generalization).
* **Optionally sweep learning rate and batch size together** for optimal scaling ("linear scaling rule": try higher learning rates for larger batches).
* Consider using **mixed precision** (FP16/AMP) to further increase throughput, although memory is not a bottleneck.
* If performance plateaus or validation Dice decreases at very large batch sizes, revert to batch size 32 or 64.

## **Conclusion**

The new sweep configuration is designed to exploit the full potential of the RTX 6000 Ada GPU, with an expanded batch size range and tuned regularization. This will enable faster experimentation and may yield new performance improvements for the U-Net segmentation task.

**Next Steps:**
Update your `sweep.yaml` as above, launch new sweeps, and analyze trends in validation Dice coefficient across the expanded batch size and learning rate ranges.
