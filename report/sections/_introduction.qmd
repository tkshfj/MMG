### 1.2 Objectives

- Apply deep learning (CNNs) to mammography image classification.
- Evaluate performance vs. traditional methods/radiologists.

### 1.3 Scope

Briefly note focus on classification (benign vs malignant), dataset used, and evaluation metrics.


Background & Motivation

- Significance of early breast cancer detection.
- NHS 2025 initiative on DL for screening.

Project Objectives

- Build and evaluate CNN models using the DDSM/CBIS-DDSM dataset.
- Assess whether CNNs can match or exceed radiologist performance.

Scope

- Focus on classification (benign vs. malignant), with optional segmentation.
- Use curated public data for transparency and reproducibility.
