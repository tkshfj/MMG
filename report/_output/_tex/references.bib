  abstract = {Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cause of cancer death and the most common malignancy among women, posing a life-threatening risk. Treatment for breast cancer can be highly effective, with a survival chance of 90\% or higher, especially when the disease is detected early. This paper introduces a groundbreaking deep U-Net framework for mammography breast cancer images to perform automatic detection of abnormalities. The objective is to provide segmented images that show areas of tumors more accurately than other deep learning techniques. The proposed framework consists of three steps. The first step is image preprocessing using the Li algorithm to minimize the cross-entropy between the foreground and the background, contrast enhancement using contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), normalization, and median filtering. The second step involves data augmentation to mitigate overfitting and underfitting, and the final step is implementing a convolutional encoder-decoder network-based U-Net architecture, characterized by high precision in medical image analysis. The framework has been tested on two comprehensive public datasets, namely INbreast and CBIS-DDSM. Several metrics have been adopted for quantitative performance assessment, including the Dice score, sensitivity, Hausdorff distance, Jaccard coefficient, precision, and F1 score. Quantitative results on the INbreast dataset show an average Dice score of 85.61\% and a sensitivity of 81.26\%. On the CBIS-DDSM dataset, the average Dice score is 87.98\%, and the sensitivity reaches 90.58\%. The experimental results ensure earlier and more accurate abnormality detection. Furthermore, the success of the proposed deep learning framework in mammography shows promise for broader applications in medical imaging, potentially revolutionizing various radiological practices.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Published research results are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set in the area of decision support systems in mammography; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. We seek to resolve this substantial challenge by releasing an updated and standardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography. Our data set, the CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM), includes decompressed images, data selection and curation by trained mammographers, updated mass segmentation and bounding boxes, and pathologic diagnosis for training data, formatted similarly to modern computer vision data sets. The data set contains 753 calcification cases and 891 mass cases, providing a data-set size capable of analyzing decision support systems in mammography.},

  abstract = {X-ray mammography is currently considered the golden standard method for breast cancer screening, however, it has limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. With the rapid advancements in deep learning techniques, it is possible to customize mammography for each patient, providing more accurate information for risk assessment, prognosis, and treatment planning. This paper aims to study the recent achievements of deep learning-based mammography for breast cancer detection and classification. This review paper highlights the potential of deep learning-assisted X-ray mammography in improving the accuracy of breast cancer screening. While the potential benefits are clear, it is essential to address the challenges associated with implementing this technology in clinical settings. Future research should focus on refining deep learning algorithms, ensuring data privacy, improving model interpretability, and establishing generalizability to successfully integrate deep learning-assisted mammography into routine breast cancer screening programs. It is hoped that the research findings will assist investigators, engineers, and clinicians in developing more effective breast imaging tools that provide accurate diagnosis, sensitivity, and specificity for breast cancer.},
