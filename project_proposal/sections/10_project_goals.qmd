## Project Goal

* The initial prototype will aim to achieve **measurable statistical power**, establishing a strong baseline for model evaluation and iterative improvement.
* The overall goal is to **design, implement, and evaluate** a **multi-task deep learning pipeline** using the **CBIS-DDSM dataset** to perform **simultaneous segmentation, detection, and classification** of breast tumors in mammographic images.
* The model will not only **classify** but also **localize lesions**, improving its relevance and applicability in **real-world screening scenarios**.
* By leveraging a publicly available, **expert-annotated mammography dataset**, the approach integrates **convolutional** and **transformer-based architectures** to balance **model performance** with **clinical interpretability**.
