## Universal Deep Learning Workflow

This project will follow the deep learning workflow outlined by Chollet (2021)[@chollet2021], encompassing:

1. Define the Problem
   Task type (e.g., classification), inputs/outputs, evaluation metrics.

2. Prepare the Data
   Collect, clean, preprocess, split (train/val/test), and augment if needed.

3. Design the Model
   Choose architecture, layers, activations, and loss function.

4. Configure Training
   Set optimizer, learning rate, batch size, epochs, callbacks.

5. Train the Model
   Fit to data, monitor metrics, handle overfitting.

6. Evaluate Performance
   Test on unseen data using appropriate metrics.

7. Tune and Iterate
   Refine hyperparameters or architecture; retrain.

8. Deploy the Model
   Export and integrate into production or application.

The implementation will use TensorFlow/Keras,[@tensorflowteam2015] following best practices for medical image analysis.

### Core Tasks in Breast Imaging
The model will address three key tasks commonly encountered in mammography-based diagnosis:

- Segmentation: Delineate tumor boundaries and lesion shapes  
- Detection: Identify and localize suspicious regions (bounding boxes or masks)  
- Classification: Determine tumor type (e.g., benign vs. malignant)
- Risk Prediction: Estimate likelihood of malignancy based on imaging features
