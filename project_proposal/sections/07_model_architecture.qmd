## Stage 2 — Enhanced CNNs and U-Net with Transfer Learning

This stage improves classification accuracy and introduces segmentation to localize lesions on mammograms.

#### 2A. Enhanced CNNs for Classification

* Regularization: Dropout, L2 weight decay
* Augmentation: Random flip, rotation, zoom, shift
* Training Strategies: Early stopping, model checkpointing
* Validation: Hold-out or stratified K-fold cross-validation
* Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision–recall curves, confusion matrix

#### 2B. U-Net for Lesion Segmentation

U-Net enables pixel-wise lesion localization, improving interpretability and model trust.[@ronneberger2015;@el-banby2024]

Architecture:

* Encoder–decoder structure with skip connections
* Input: Grayscale or RGB mammogram
* Output: Binary lesion mask

Variants:

* Vanilla U-Net: Trained from scratch using CBIS-DDSM segmentation masks
* Transfer Learning U-Net:

  * Pretrained encoder (e.g., ResNet34, VGG16)
  * Decoder randomly initialized

Loss Functions:

* Dice coefficient
* Combined binary crossentropy + IoU loss
