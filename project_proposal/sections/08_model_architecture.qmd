## Stage 3: Advanced Modeling Strategies

**Goal:** Integrate transfer learning, multi-task learning (MTL), and transformers for clinical-grade performance.

### 3A. Transfer Learning

* **Backbones:** EfficientNetB0–B3, ResNet50, InceptionV3
* **Input:** RGB mammograms (ImageNet-aligned)
* **Output:** Custom binary classification head
* **Fine-tuning:** Freeze -> unfreeze lower layers for full training

### 3B. Multi-Task Learning (MTL)

* **Architecture:** Shared encoder -> dual heads

  * *Classification:* Benign vs. malignant
  * *Segmentation:* Lesion mask
* **Loss:** `Total = α * SegLoss + β * ClsLoss`
* **Advantages:**

  * Better generalization
  * Data-efficient
  * Diagnosis + localization

### 3C. Transformer Models

* **Models:** ViT, Swin Transformer
* **Mechanism:** Patch embedding + self-attention
* **Hybrids:** TransUNet, ViT-U-Net
* **Benefits:**

  * Captures global context
  * Attention-based interpretability
  * Flexible for multiple tasks

### 3D. Interpretability & Evaluation

* **Tools:** Grad-CAM, saliency maps, attention heatmaps
* **Visualize with:** TensorBoard, Weights & Biases
* **Metrics:**

  * *Classification:* Accuracy, AUC, F1
  * *Segmentation:* Dice, IoU

*Optional: ensembles, attention-guided loss, model calibration*

<!-- 
The final stage integrates transfer learning, multi-task learning (MTL), and transformer-based models to approach clinical-grade performance.

#### 3A. Transfer Learning for Classification

* Backbones: EfficientNetB0–B3, ResNet50, InceptionV3
* Input: Mammograms converted to RGB to match ImageNet pretrained weights
* Output: Custom classification head for binary prediction
* Fine-tuning: Lower layers frozen initially, later unfrozen for end-to-end training

#### 3B. Multi-Task Learning (MTL)

Jointly learns classification and segmentation tasks from a shared representation.

Architecture:

* Shared encoder (CNN or Transformer)
* Two output heads:

  * Classification Head: Benign vs. malignant
  * Segmentation Head: Lesion mask

Loss Function:

```
TotalLoss = α * SegmentationLoss + β * ClassificationLoss
```

Advantages:

* Enhanced generalization
* Efficient use of limited data
* Clinically aligned: diagnosis + localization in one model

#### 3C. Transformer-Based Architectures

Modern self-attention architectures improve global context awareness.

* Models: Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer
* Mechanism: Patch embedding + self-attention layers
* Hybrid Options: TransUNet or ViT-U-Net (CNN encoder + Transformer decoder)

Benefits:

* Better global context capture
* Interpretable via attention heatmaps
* Flexible for both classification and segmentation

#### 3D. Interpretability and Benchmarking

Interpretability Tools:

* Grad-CAM
* Saliency maps
* Attention heatmaps
* Visualization with TensorBoard, Weights & Biases

Benchmarking Strategy:

* Compare model performance across stages
* Classification metrics: Accuracy, AUC, F1-score
* Segmentation metrics: Dice coefficient, IoU

> Optional extensions include ensemble models, attention-guided loss functions, and model calibration techniques. -->
