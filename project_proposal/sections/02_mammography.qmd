## Medical Imaging in Breast Cancer Detection

**Mammography** remains the gold standard for early breast cancer detection, offering standardized views like **CC** and **MLO**.
Lesions are assessed based on shape, margins, calcification patterns, and asymmetries.
However, it has limitations:

- Reduced sensitivity in **dense breasts** (BI-RADS C/D)
- High **false positive** rates → unnecessary biopsies
- Limited **specificity** between benign and malignant lesions

**Complementary modalities** include:

- **DBT (3D mammography)**: improves lesion visibility, reduces recall
- **Ultrasound/MRI**: useful for dense tissue and high-risk cases
- **PET**: high sensitivity but limited by cost and availability

**BI-RADS categories** standardize reporting, from 0 (incomplete) to 6 (biopsy-confirmed malignancy).

### Mammography: The Gold Standard

- Primary tool for early detection  
- **Limitations**:  
  - Decreased sensitivity in **dense breasts** (BI-RADS C/D)  
  - Increased **false positives** → unnecessary biopsies  
  - Limited **specificity** between benign and malignant findings

---

### Complementary Modalities

- **Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)**  
  - 3D imaging improves lesion visibility  
  - Reduces recall rates  
- **Ultrasound / MRI**  
  - Effective for dense tissue and high-risk populations  
- **PET (Positron Emission Tomography)**  
  - Functional imaging with high sensitivity  
  - Limited use due to cost and complexity

### Mammography Essentials

- **Standard Views**  
  - CC (Cranio-Caudal) and MLO (Mediolateral Oblique)  
- **Lesion Assessment**  
  - Masses: shape and margin  
  - Calcifications: morphology and distribution  
  - Architectural distortion, asymmetry

### BI-RADS Categories

- 0: Incomplete – further imaging needed  
- 1–2: Negative or benign  
- 3: Probably benign – short-interval follow-up  
- 4–5: Suspicious or likely malignant – biopsy recommended  
- 6: Biopsy-proven malignancy -->
