## Model Architecture Roadmap for Breast Cancer Detection

We adopt a staged modeling framework. This project will evolve from foundational convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to advanced transformer-based multi-task architectures for detecting and localizing breast cancer in CBIS-DDSM mammograms.

### Core Mammography Tasks

- Segmentation – Outline tumors and lesions
- Detection – Locate suspicious regions
- Classification – Predict benign vs. malignant
- *Risk Prediction – Estimate malignancy likelihood*

## Stage 1 — Baseline CNN for Binary Classification

The first stage establishes a performance baseline using a simple CNN to classify mammograms as *benign* or *malignant*.

Architecture:

* Input: Grayscale mammogram, resized to a fixed shape (e.g., `(512, 512, 1)`)
* 2–3 convolutional layers with ReLU activations and MaxPooling
* 1–2 dense layers, optionally followed by Dropout
* Output: `Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")`

Training:

* Loss: Binary crossentropy
* Optimizer: Adam
* Metrics: Accuracy, AUC

> Overfitting is expected at this stage, emphasizing the importance of data augmentation and regularization in later stages.
