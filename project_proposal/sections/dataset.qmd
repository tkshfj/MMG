## Dataset

### Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)

A publicly available legacy dataset of over 2,500 scanned film mammography studies (\~10,480 high-resolution grayscale images, typically \~4,000 × 5,000 pixels), developed to support early research in computer-aided detection (CAD) for breast cancer. It includes detailed annotations of abnormalities (masses, calcifications, asymmetries), BI-RADS assessments, pathology-confirmed labels (benign or malignant), and ROI contours.

### Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM)[@lee2017]

A curated, modern subset of the DDSM hosted on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), comprising 3,102 mammography cases (\~3,000 high-resolution grayscale images). Each case includes expert-annotated lesions (masses, calcifications, architectural distortions) with pathology-confirmed labels (benign or malignant), as well as metadata such as patient age, breast laterality, and view type (CC or MLO). The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, and supports segmentation, detection, and classification tasks—making it ideal for multi-task learning and widely used in breast cancer AI research.

### Ethical Considerations

This study uses the de-identified, publicly available CBIS-DDSM dataset with BI-RADS and pathology labels. Although no new human subjects are involved, the data is treated as sensitive, adhering to ethical guidelines. Limitations include potential demographic bias and outdated imaging technology. Results require validation before clinical use. No deception or incentives are involved, and open-access publication is encouraged for transparency.
