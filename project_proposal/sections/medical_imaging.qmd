## Medical Imaging in Breast Cancer Detection

### Breast Cancer Screening
- **Mammography** is the clinical gold standard for early detection.
- However, it has notable **limitations**:
- Reduced sensitivity in **dense breast tissue**
- High rate of **false positives**, leading to unnecessary biopsies
- **Limited specificity** in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions

### Complementary Imaging Modalities
- **Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)**:
  - 3D imaging that improves lesion visibility and reduces recall rates
- **Ultrasound / MRI**:
  - Effective for dense breasts and high-risk populations
- **PET (Positron Emission Tomography)**:
  - Offers functional imaging with high sensitivity
  - Limited by high cost and complexity
