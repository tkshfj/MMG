  abstract = {Abstract             Published research results are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set in the area of decision support systems in mammography; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. We seek to resolve this substantial challenge by releasing an updated and standardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography. Our data set, the CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM), includes decompressed images, data selection and curation by trained mammographers, updated mass segmentation and bounding boxes, and pathologic diagnosis for training data, formatted similarly to modern computer vision data sets. The data set contains 753 calcification cases and 891 mass cases, providing a data-set size capable of analyzing decision support systems in mammography.},

  abstract = {X-ray mammography is currently considered the golden standard method for breast cancer screening, however, it has limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. With the rapid advancements in deep learning techniques, it is possible to customize mammography for each patient, providing more accurate information for risk assessment, prognosis, and treatment planning. This paper aims to study the recent achievements of deep learning-based mammography for breast cancer detection and classification. This review paper highlights the potential of deep learning-assisted X-ray mammography in improving the accuracy of breast cancer screening. While the potential benefits are clear, it is essential to address the challenges associated with implementing this technology in clinical settings. Future research should focus on refining deep learning algorithms, ensuring data privacy, improving model interpretability, and establishing generalizability to successfully integrate deep learning-assisted mammography into routine breast cancer screening programs. It is hoped that the research findings will assist investigators, engineers, and clinicians in developing more effective breast imaging tools that provide accurate diagnosis, sensitivity, and specificity for breast cancer.},
