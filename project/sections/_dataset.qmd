### 2.1 Dataset Description

- Dataset: CBIS-DDSM
- Number of cases: 753 calcifications, 891 masses
- Modalities: Mammograms with labels and ROI masks

### 2.2 Preprocessing

- Resizing, normalization, augmentation
- ROI extraction (if applied)

### 2.3 Splitting Strategy

- Training, validation, and test set proportions
- Use of predefined splits if applicable

Dataset Description

- Use of CBIS-DDSM (Lee et al., 2017) â€” curated version of DDSM.
- Number of images, classes (benign/malignant), calcifications vs. masses.

Preprocessing Steps

- ROI extraction, resizing, normalization.
- Augmentation techniques (flipping, rotation, etc.).

Train/Validation/Test Split

- Based on BI-RADS or predefined splits from the dataset.
