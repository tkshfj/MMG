# Deep Learning Architectures

<!-- * Review key algorithms (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, MTL models).
* Discuss results and challenges.
* Compare different architectures if relevant. -->

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

<!-- * Describe techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, explainability.
* Justify their use in your project. -->

Rafid et al. (2022) used a modified VGG-16 to classify benign and malignant lesions, achieving strong performance with Grad-CAM visualizations [@rafid2022]. However, overfitting remains a concern due to dataset imbalance.

## Vision Transformers (ViTs)

Kumar and Saha (2024) applied a transformer-based model to classify breast cancer lesions, demonstrating competitive accuracy with reduced reliance on large convolutional filters [@kumarsaha2024].
