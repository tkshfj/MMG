# Multi-task Learning and Explainability

<!-- * Summarize tools such as Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP.
* Discuss relevance for healthcare and interpretability. -->

Murty et al. (2024) proposed a multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly perform classification and segmentation, improving robustness [@murty2024]. For interpretability, techniques like Grad-CAM and SHAP are commonly employed [@khourdifi2024].

While CNNs dominate the field, transformer-based approaches are emerging, especially for capturing global context. Datasets like CBIS-DDSM enable standardization, but domain shift and lack of diversity remain challenges. Multi-task frameworks show potential for clinically relevant outcomes.
