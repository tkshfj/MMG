# Introduction

* Importance of the problem domain.
* Aim of the literature review.
* Overview of what will be covered (e.g., datasets, models, techniques, gaps).

Early detection of breast cancer through mammography significantly improves treatment outcomes. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promising performance in automating this task, particularly with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). This literature review surveys key datasets, architectures, and methods relevant to our project, highlighting current challenges and research gaps.
