# Datasets and Benchmarks

<!-- * Introduce key datasets used in the field (e.g., CBIS-DDSM, INbreast).
* Mention how they are structured and annotated.
* Discuss strengths and limitations. -->

## CBIS-DDSM

Lee et al. (2017) curated the CBIS-DDSM dataset, an enhanced version of the original DDSM archive, which provides segmented regions of interest and pathology-confirmed labels. This dataset is widely used for training and benchmarking deep learning models in mammography research [@lee2017].

## INbreast

The INbreast dataset offers full-field digital mammograms with detailed BI-RADS annotations. While limited in size, it is useful for validation and fine-tuning models trained on larger datasets.
